This is a full-stack appliaction where the user can play roulette. They can pick a square and place a bet.  Next, they click play and then, the computer generates the winning square. If it is a match, then the player wins. If not, then, the casino wins. 

The casino owner can make an account and log in to the page to view how much profit they have made.

### How It's Made:

This project uses EJS, CSS, and JavaScript on the front-end and Node.js + Express.js, and MongoDB on the back-end. 


### Lesson Learned

I learned how to use CRUD functions to operate on stored data in MongoDB. Also, I learned how to use EJS, a simple templating language that allow us to generate HTML markup with Javascript.
